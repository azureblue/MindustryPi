# MindustryRPi
Mindustry for RaspberryPi!

What is needed:
- Raspberry Pi 4 (Rpi 3 not tested, but should work)
- vc4 fake/full kms driver (dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d or dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d in /boot/config.txt)
- proper gpu_mem setting (tested with 128mb)
- SDL (on rpi4: sudo apt install libsdl2-2.0 0)
- java (sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre)
- recommended (yet on your own responsibility :P) RPi overclocking ;)
